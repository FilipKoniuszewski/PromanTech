- Codecool Project

## Story

### An email from the client

```
From: Mark Smith <ceo@thepartner.com>

Subject: Welcome on board the ProMan project!

In these days, everyone wants to create a new project management tool,
and we're no exception. We'd like to implement
something similar to Trello, so we can say we have our own tool!

We call it: ProMan

Jacob, our senior full-stack developer already started to work on the project.
He made sure to have a proper backlog, and he started to work on the wireframe
of the application.

Unfortunately Jacob was late one day, he arrived to work at 9:02,
so we had to fire him. Work starts at 9am, he had to learn it.

Now it's your job to finish the project!
Send us the sprint backlog ASAP, and we'll meet at the demo!

Remember, we need completed user stories and quality work!

Mark

Oh well, another nice client.

From the attachments, you can see that they imagine the app as a "one pager", where all
the boards are displayed, and when one is opened, the corresponding cards are shown.
Their [screen plan](media/web-python/proman-screen-plan.png)
is not too sophisticated but seems to be a good staring point.

Of course, the customer would love to have an application which is easy to use at first
glance, where functionality is straightforward, and the application looks nice on different screen sizes if possible.
As this is [usually](media/web-python/specification-vs-reality.png) the case.
Let's get this job done.
